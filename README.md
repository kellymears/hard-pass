# Hard Pass

WordPress Plugin for maintaining a hardcoded block blacklist (in PHP).

## Installation

Vendor directory is included in this repo so you can just install it like a normal plugin without composer. Requires PHP 7.1.3, I think.

## Usage

Install and modify `blacklist.config.php` to fit your desires. My personal wrecking ball is included.
